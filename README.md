## Contributing

While the initial MVP is under works I won't be accepting any contributions. Once a lot of the APIs and designs are finalized then you'll be able to create your own games, improve systems, and get your name automatically listed in-game!

This game does not and will not have any monetization. It is a place for people to meet and make friends, and a strong learning resource for developers wanting to learn about tools and workflows such as [Rojo](https://rojo.space), [Roact](https://roblox.github.io/roact/), [Rodux](https://roblox.github.io/rodux/), or [roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com).
